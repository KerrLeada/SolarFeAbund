# This file contains example atomic data used to synthezise lines. It exists to demonstrate what data is needed, how it is formatted,
# and so on. Essentially, to synthezise lines we need atomic data about the atom and isotope in question. This data is stored in
# cfg files, which are essentially tables of atomic data. The rows represents data about the relevant atomic transitions, and the
# columns represents information and properties of the transition. Specfically, the columns contain the following information:
#
#       Label, Element, Ion, Atomic number, Wavelength [Å], log(gf), J_low, J_up, g_low, g_up, energy low [eV], gamma rad, gamma strk, vdW/Bark, wid
#
# They describe the following:
#       Label: The name of the transition/whatever (??? IS IT? GUESSING HERE! ???).
#       Element: The relevant element, for example iron. Note that this should be the short names in the periodic table, to iron would be Fe.
#       Ion: The relevant ion. A not ionized atom would have the number 1, the first ionization stage 2, the third (if there is one) would be 3 and so on.
#       Atomic number: The atomic number of the element.
#       Wavelength: The wavelength of the transition, in Ångström.
#       log(gf): The logarithm of g (??? WHAT WAS g AGAIN? ???) and the oscillator strength f.
#       J_low: ???
#       J_up:  ???
#       g_low: ???
#       g_up:  ???
#       Energy low: The energy of the lower energy level, given in electron volts (eV).
#       gamma rad:  ???
#       gamma strk: ???
#       vdW/Bark:   ???
#       wid:        ???
