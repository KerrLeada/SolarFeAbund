This repository is related to my bachelor work. It's basically just a backup, put on github for the entire world to "enjoy"... the code isn't the best, some parts ar outdated and won't work and it's poorly documented. All of this is because of the experimental nature of the project (have to try what works and so on). It relies on external code and libraries not available to the public, so this isn't useful to anyone right now. And some external data files are not included either.
